FREDERICK DOUGLBUTT
===================

This is an ultra-simple (sorta) IRC bot that uses irclib. A little messy,
but I'm ok with it. You can write new plugins pretty simply.

  * Subclass ButtPlugin
  * define __provides__
  * define do_commands and optionally on_events
  * define timed events (good example is twitter.py)
  * edit plugins/__init__.py

But, honestly, this bot isn't really suitable for anyone without a decent
chunk of Python knowledge.

REQUIREMENTS
============

Tumblr support requires:

  * pymblr http://github.com/lysol/pymblr
  * poster http://atlee.ca/software/poster/
  * elementtree http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm
  * mechanize http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/

All but poster and pymblr should be available via easy_install. Tumblr support relies on pymblr's autopost_url, so any of the forks should be ok, and I try to merge in improvements from the forks.

Twitter support requires nothing! That's because I just copied the API module into the plugin directory. It's also oauthified, so you don't have to freak out about your twitter anymore.
